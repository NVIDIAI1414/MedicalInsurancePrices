# MedicalInsurancePrices

Medical Insurance data is from the Kaggle repository, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance?resource=downloa 

The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate data gathering, wrangling, data exploration and then performing linear regression/random forest algorithms to determine medical insurance costs from the dataset.

One can use scatter plots and a correlation matrix to demonstrate a strong correlation between log(charges) and bmi/age/smoker status. 

I confirm that log(charges) does increase with bmi/age/smoker status as risk of earlier death increases.
